Basic Neural Network

-----------------------------------------------
Welcome to Lou's Neural Network! The files in this folder are used to create a generic backpropagation neural network that can be used to model the relationship between a dataset of inputs and outputs. 
-----------------------------------------------

Usage
-----
Compile all Java files in the Basic Neural Network folder:
	javac *.java

Use the Driver to run each different test (KFold or Survey) or to serialize a collection of neural networks to be used later:
	java Driver

If any changes are made to any source files (in order to run different tests or to change parameters) make sure to recompile!

Notes on Datasets
-----------------
Any dataset can be transformed into an array of usable objects (IOTuple) for this neural network framework by using the DataParser. The data must be pre-formatted like so:

Input, Input, Input,...
Output
Input, Input, Input,...
Output
Input, Input, Input,...
Output
Input, Input, Input,...
Output
etc.

One Final Note - For the Computational Chemist
----------------------------------------------
The pybelData.txt was created using a programming package called Cinfony. The collection of input parameters was created using a dataset [Zhao, 2012] and a function from Cinfony: calcfp(). From what I understand this creates a molecular fingerprint from a molecule given a chemical structure (input as a SMILES string). If anyone knows the inner workings behind calcfp() or any Cinfony function please let me know! It would be of great value.
