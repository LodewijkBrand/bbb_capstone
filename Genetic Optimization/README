Genetic Optimization

-----------------------------------------------
Welcome to Lou's Neural Network Genetic Algorithm Optimization! The files in this folder are used to optimize the "baked-in" parameters used in the Basic Neural Network. 
-----------------------------------------------

Usage
-----
Compile all Java files in the Genetic Optimization folder:
	javac *.java

Use the Driver to optimize the learning rate, momentum, and hidden node ratio of a population of neural networks. Take the values displayed on the terminal and copy them over into the Basic Neural Network and see if there are any optimizations!
	java Driver

Remember to always recompile if any changes are made!

Notes on Schemas, Crossover, and Mutation
-----------------------------------------
The Schema of a neural network represents the chromosome in a genetic algorithm. The Schema holds all of the important parameter information for a neural network. Crossover and mutation are therefore defined in regards to crossing over only parameters, not (for example) the individual edges contained in a neural network. It may be more successful to redefine these three pieces in order to improve the performance of the genetic algorithm.
